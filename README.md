## Overview

This is an old app (built ~2010) which I am trying to drag into the modern era. Moved to Typescript, ultimately aiming to move to React or something equally modern. (i.e bye bye jQuery :-O)

In oder to build the Typescript to run in the browser use the following steps.

### setup

```
npm i
```

### build

```
npm run build
```
